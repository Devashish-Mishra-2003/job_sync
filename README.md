# JobSync  

**JobSync** is an **AI-powered platform** designed to streamline and enhance the **job application process** for both **students** and **placement teams**.  
It provides **instant, data-driven feedback** on resume-to-job-description compatibility — turning a historically manual and opaque process into an **efficient and transparent experience**.

**About the Project**  
This project was built for the **Code 5 Edu-Tech Hackathon** as a solution for **Theme 2**.  

---

**How It Works**  

JobSync is built on a **modern, decoupled architecture**, making it scalable and reliable.  
It consists of two main components:  

**Frontend (Streamlit)**  
- User-friendly interface for students and placement teams  
- Students can upload resumes and get instant compatibility feedback  
- Placement teams get a dashboard to manage job descriptions and evaluate candidates  

**Backend (FastAPI)**  
- High-performance API for all the heavy lifting  
- Handles resume & JD parsing, compatibility scoring, and detailed feedback  
- Independent deployment for smooth scalability  

Decoupled Deployment: A surge in frontend traffic won’t slow down backend evaluations 

---

**Key Features**  

- ✅ Instant Resume Evaluation → Compatibility score + verdict (High, Medium, Low)  
- ✅ Actionable Feedback → Concrete suggestions to improve resumes (skills, projects, etc.)  
- ✅ Placement Team Dashboard → Upload JDs, evaluate candidates, filter & export results  
- ✅ Scalable Architecture → Independent scaling of backend & frontend services  
- ✅ AI-Ready → Future integration with LLM-powered semantic analysis for deeper matching

**Tech Stack**  

- **Frontend:** Streamlit   
- **Backend:** FastAPI 
- **Parsing:** pdfplumber, python-docx   
- **Other Dependencies:** requests, numpy, uvicorn, python-multipart  
- **Hosting:**  
  - Frontend → Streamlit Cloud  
  - Backend → Render  

---

**Deployment Strategy**  

- **Backend (FastAPI):**  
  - Deployed on Render using `render.yaml` blueprint  
  - Auto-scales to handle incoming requests  

- **Frontend (Streamlit):**  
  - Deployed on Vercel / Streamlit Cloud  
  - Connects to live backend using environment variable `BACKEND_URL`
